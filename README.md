## Getting Started

The Cypress Real-World App (RWA) is a full-stack Express/React application backed by a local JSON database ([lowdb]).

The app is bundled with [example data](./data/database.json) (`data/database.json`) that contains everything you need to start using the app and run tests out-of-the-box.

> ðŸš© **Note**
>
> You can login to the app with any of the [example app users](./data/database.json#L2). The default password for all users is `s3cret`.  
> Example users can be seen by running `yarn list:dev:users`.

### Prerequisites

The only requirement for this project is to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) **version 14** installed on your machine. Refer to the [.node-version](./.node-version) file for the exact version.

TypeScript will be added as a local dependency to the project, so no need to install it.

### Installation

```shell
yarn install
```

#### Mac M1 chip users will need to prepend `PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD=true`.

```shell
PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD=true yarn install
```

### Run the app

```shell
yarn dev
```

> ðŸš© **Note**
>
> The app will run on port `3000` (frontend) and `3001` (API backend) by default. Please make sure there are no other applications or services running on both ports.
> If you want to change the default ports, you can do so by modifying `PORT` and `REACT_APP_BACKEND_PORT` variables in `.env` file.
> However, make sure the modified port numbers in `.env` are not committed into Git since the CI environments still expect the application to run on the default ports.

### Start Cypress

```shell
yarn cypress:open
```

> ðŸš© **Note**
>
> If you have changed the default ports, then you need to update Cypress configuration file (`cypress.json`) locally.
> There are three properties that you need to update in `cypress.json`: `baseUrl`, `apiUrl`, and `url`.
> The port number in `baseUrl` corresponds to `PORT` variable in `.env` file. Similarly, the port number in `apiUrl` and `url` correspond to `REACT_APP_BACKEND_PORT`.
> For example, if you have changed `PORT` to `13000` and `REACT_APP_BACKEND_PORT` to `13001` in `.env` file, then your `cypress.json` should look similar to the following snippet:
>
> ```json
> {
>   "baseUrl": "http://localhost:13000",
>   /* Omitted for brevity */
>   "env": {
>     "apiUrl": "http://localhost:13001",
>     /* Omitted for brevity */
>     "codeCoverage": {
>       "url": "http://localhost:13001/__coverage__"
>     }
>   },
>   "experimentalStudio": true
> }
> ```



## Database

- The local JSON database is located in [data/database.json](./data/database.json) and is managed with [lowdb].

- The database is [reseeded](./data/database-seed.json) each time the application is started (via `yarn dev`). Database seeding is done in between each [Cypress End-to-End test](./cypress/tests).

- Updates via the React frontend are sent to the [Express][express] server and handled by a set of [database utilities](backend/database.ts)

- Generate a new database using `yarn db:seed`.

- An [empty database seed](./data/empty-seed.json) is provided along with a script (`yarn start:empty`) to view the application without data.
